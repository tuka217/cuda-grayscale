This project presents a common technique for converting colored images to their grayscale representation using CUDA enabled GPUs for processing.

This multi-platform implementation uses OpenCV for managing image files, while the conversion algorithm takes into consideration different weighting of the color channels for a more effective representation of the colored image.
